* This open-source project aims to train a super-small language model **MiniMind** with only 3 RMB cost and 2 hours,
  starting completely from scratch.
* The **MiniMind** series is extremely lightweight, with the smallest version being $\frac{1}{7000}$ the size of GPT-3,
  making it possible to train quickly on even the most ordinary personal GPUs.
* The project also open-sources the minimalist structure of the large model, including extensions for shared mixed
  experts (MoE), dataset cleaning, pretraining, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), LoRA fine-tuning, direct preference
  optimization (DPO) algorithms, reinforcement learning from AI feedback (RLAIF: PPO/GRPO/SPO), and model distillation 
  algorithms, along with the full code of the entire process.
* **MiniMind** also expands into vision multimodal VLM: [MiniMind-V](https://github.com/jingyaogong/minimind-v).
* All core algorithm code is reconstructed from scratch using native PyTorch! It does not rely on abstract interfaces
  provided by third-party libraries.
* This is not only a full-stage open-source reproduction of a large language model but also a tutorial for beginners in
  LLM.
* We hope this project will serve as an inspiring example for everyone, helping to enjoy the fun of creation and
  promoting the progress of the wider AI community!

> To avoid misunderstanding, the "2 hours" test is based on NVIDIA 3090 hardware (single GPU), and the "3 RMB" refers to the GPU server rental cost. Details of the specifications can be found below.

# 📌 Introduction

The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has sparked unprecedented global attention to AI. 
Whether it's ChatGPT, DeepSeek, or Qwen, they all demonstrate stunning performance that is awe-inspiring.
However, with their massive scale of tens of billions of parameters, they are not only difficult to train on personal devices but nearly impossible to deploy.
Opening the "black box" of large models to explore their internal mechanisms is truly thrilling!
Unfortunately, 99% of exploration can only stop at using techniques like LoRA to perform minor fine-tuning on existing large models to learn new instructions or tasks.
This is like teaching Newton how to use a 21st-century smartphone—while interesting, it completely deviates from the original intent of understanding the essence of physics.
Meanwhile, third-party large model frameworks and toolkits, such as transformers+trl, expose only highly abstract interfaces.
With just 10 lines of code, you can complete the entire workflow of "loading model + loading dataset + inference + reinforcement learning."
While such efficient packaging is convenient, it also acts like a high-speed spacecraft, isolating developers from underlying implementations and hindering deep exploration of LLM core code.
Yet, "building a plane with Lego is far more exciting than flying in first class!"
What's worse, the internet is flooded with expensive courses and marketing accounts selling AI tutorials with countless flaws and superficial understanding.
For this reason, this project's original intention is to lower the barrier to entry for LLM learning, allowing everyone to start by understanding every line of code,
to personally train an extremely small language model from scratch. Yes, from **training from scratch**, not just **inference**!
With less than 3 RMB in server costs, you can personally experience the entire process of building a language model from 0 to 1.
Let's enjoy the fun of creation together!

> [!NOTE]
> (As of 2025-10) The MiniMind series has completed pretraining of multiple model variants, with the smallest being only 25.8M (0.02B), capable of fluent conversation!

```text
To be compatible with third-party inference frameworks llama.cpp and vllm, this update requires some observable costs.
This update no longer supports "directly" loading old models before 25-04-26 for inference.
Due to differences in Llama's positional encoding compared to minimind, there are differences in QK values after mapping Llama models.
MiniMind2 series old models have been recovered through weight mapping and (fine-tuning training) QKVO linear layer calibration.
After this update, maintenance of the entire minimind-v1 series will be abandoned and removed from the repository.

### 1. Environment Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt -i https://mirrors.aliyun.com/pypi/simple
```

<details style="color:rgb(128,128,128)">
<summary>Note: Test Torch CUDA availability in advance</summary>

```bash
import torch
print(torch.cuda.is_available())
```

If not available, please download and install the whl file from [torch_stable](https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html). Reference [link](https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_45456738/article/details/141029610?ops_request_misc=&request_id=&biz_id=102&utm_term=%E5%AE%89%E8%A3%85torch&utm_medium=distribute.pc_search_result.none-task-blog-2~all~sobaiduweb~default-2-141029610.nonecase&spm=1018.2226.3001.4187)

</details>

### 2. Download Data

Download the required data files from the [dataset download link](https://www.modelscope.cn/datasets/gongjy/minimind_dataset/files) provided below (create the `./dataset` directory) and place them in `./dataset`

<details style="color:rgb(128,128,128)">
<summary>Note: Dataset Notes</summary>

By default, it is recommended to download `pretrain_hq.jsonl` + `sft_mini_512.jsonl` for the fastest reproduction of the Zero chat model.

You can freely choose data files. The section below provides multiple combination schemes that can be appropriately combined based on your training needs and GPU resources.

</details>

### 3. Start Training

Directory is located in `trainer`

<details style="color:rgb(128,128,128)">
<summary>💡 Checkpoint Resume Training</summary>

All training scripts automatically save checkpoints. Simply add `--from_resume 1` parameter to automatically detect, load & resume training:

```bash
python train_pretrain.py --from_resume 1
python train_full_sft.py --from_resume 1
...
```

**Checkpoint Resume Mechanism:**
- Training process automatically saves complete checkpoints in `./checkpoints/` directory (model, optimizer, training progress, etc.)
- Checkpoint file naming: `<weight_name>_<dimension>_resume.pth` (e.g., `full_sft_512_resume.pth`)
- Supports cross-GPU recovery (automatically adjusts step)
- Supports wandb training log continuity (automatically resumes the same run)

> Suitable for long training sessions or unstable environments, no need to worry about progress loss from interruptions

</details>

**3.1 Pretraining (Learning Knowledge)**

```bash
python train_pretrain.py
```

> Execute pretraining to get `pretrain_*.pth` as the output weights for pretraining (where * is the model's dimension, default is 512)

Optional save controls:
- `--save_by step|epoch`: save history checkpoints by step or by epoch
- `--save_interval`: save interval under the selected granularity
- `--max_ckpts N`: keep at most `N` historical checkpoints; omit it to keep all

**3.2 Supervised Fine-tuning (Learning Conversation Style)**

```bash
python train_full_sft.py
```

> Execute supervised fine-tuning to get `full_sft_*.pth` as the output weights for instruction fine-tuning (where `full` means full-parameter fine-tuning)

<details style="color:rgb(128,128,128)">
<summary>Note: Training Notes</summary>

By default, all training processes keep the latest weights in `./out/***.pth`; if history checkpoint saving is enabled, `--save_by` and `--max_ckpts` control the retention policy.

For simplicity, only the two-stage training process is described here. For other training (LoRA, distillation, reinforcement learning, inference fine-tuning, etc.), refer to the detailed description in the [Experiment](#-experiment) section below.

</details>

---

### 4. Test Your Trained Model

Ensure the model `*.pth` files to be tested are in the `./out/` directory.
You can also directly download and use the `*.pth` files I trained from [here](https://www.modelscope.cn/models/gongjy/MiniMind2-PyTorch/files).

```bash
python eval_llm.py --weight full_sft # or pretrain/dpo/ppo/grpo...
```

<details style="color:rgb(128,128,128)">
<summary>Note: Testing Notes</summary>

The `--weight` parameter specifies the weight name prefix. Options: `pretrain`, `full_sft`, `dpo`, `reason`, `ppo_actor`, `grpo`, `spo`, etc.

Other common parameters:
- `--load_from`: Model loading path (`model`=native torch weights, other paths=transformers format)
- `--save_dir`: Model weight directory (default `out`)
- `--lora_weight`: LoRA weight name (`None` means not used)
- `--historys`: Number of historical dialogue rounds to carry (must be even, 0 means no history)
- `--max_new_tokens`: Maximum generation length (default 8192)
- `--temperature`: Generation temperature (default 0.85)
- `--top_p`: Nucleus sampling threshold (default 0.85)


For usage details, refer directly to the `eval_llm.py` code.

</details>

---

> [!TIP]
> All training scripts are native PyTorch framework, supporting multi-GPU acceleration. Assume your device has N (N > 1) GPUs:

Single machine N GPU training startup (DDP, supports multi-machine multi-GPU cluster)

```bash
torchrun --nproc_per_node N train_xxx.py
```

<details style="color:rgb(128,128,128)">
<summary>Note: Other Notes</summary>

<del>
Single machine N GPU training (DeepSpeed)

```bash
deepspeed --master_port 29500 --num_gpus=N train_xxx.py
```
</del>

You can optionally enable wandb to record the training process (requires direct internet connection)

```bash
# Requires login: wandb login
torchrun --nproc_per_node N train_xxx.py --use_wandb
# and
python train_xxx.py --use_wandb
```

By adding the `--use_wandb` parameter, you can record the training process. After training is complete, you can view the training process on the wandb website. By modifying the `wandb_project` and `wandb_run_name` parameters, you can specify the project name and run name.

[Note]: After June 2025, the domestic network environment cannot directly connect to WandB. The MiniMind project by default switches to using [SwanLab](https://swanlab.cn/) as the training visualization tool (fully compatible with WandB API), that is, just change `import wandb` to `import swanlab as wandb`, no other changes are needed.

</details>

# 📌 Data Introduction

## Ⅰ Tokenizer

Tokenizer maps words from natural language to numbers like `0, 1, 36` through a "dictionary," which can be understood as numbers representing the page number of the word in the "dictionary."
You can choose to construct your own vocabulary table to train a "dictionary." The code can be found in `./trainer/train_tokenizer.py` (for learning reference only. It's not necessary to train one yourself unless required. MiniMind comes with a built-in tokenizer).
Or you can choose tokenizers from well-known open-source large models.
Just as using Xinhua/Oxford dictionaries directly has the advantage of good token encoding compression, but the disadvantage of having too many pages—tens of thousands of word phrases;
A self-trained tokenizer has the advantage of freely controlling vocabulary length and content, but the disadvantage of low compression ratio (for example, "hello" might be split into "h e l l o"
five independent tokens), and rare words are difficult to cover.
The choice of "dictionary" is important. The output of LLM is essentially a multi-class classification problem with SoftMax to N words in the dictionary, then decoding to natural language through the "dictionary."
Because MiniMind size needs to be strictly controlled to avoid top-heavy models (embedding layer parameters taking up too high a proportion of LLM), shorter vocabulary lengths are better.

<details style="color:rgb(128,128,128)">
<summary>Tokenizer Introduction</summary>

The tokenizer vocabulary sizes of powerful open-source models from third parties such as Yi, qwen, chatglm, mistral, and Llama3 are as follows:

<table>
  <tr><th>Tokenizer Model</th><th>Vocabulary Size</th><th>Source</th></tr>
  <tr><td>yi tokenizer</td><td>64,000</td><td>01AI (China)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>qwen2 tokenizer</td><td>151,643</td><td>Alibaba Cloud (China)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>glm tokenizer</td><td>151,329</td><td>Zhipu AI (China)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>mistral tokenizer</td><td>32,000</td><td>Mistral AI (France)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>llama3 tokenizer</td><td>128,000</td><td>Meta (USA)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>minimind tokenizer</td><td>6,400</td><td>Custom</td></tr>
</table>

> 👉 Updated 2024-09-17: To prevent ambiguity from previous versions and control size, all MiniMind models use minimind_tokenizer for tokenization, abandoning all mistral_tokenizer versions.

```
# Some thoughts
> Although minimind_tokenizer has a small length, its encoding/decoding efficiency is weaker than Chinese-friendly tokenizers like qwen2 and glm.
> But the minimind model chose the self-trained minimind_tokenizer as the tokenizer to maintain lightweight overall parameters, avoiding imbalance in encoding layer and computation layer proportions, preventing top-heavy models, because minimind's vocabulary size is only 6400.
> And minimind has never encountered rare word decoding failures in actual testing, with good results.
> Due to the custom vocabulary compression to 6400, the total LLM parameters are as low as 25.8M.
> The training data `pretrain_hq.jsonl` all comes from the `JiangShu large model dataset`, this part of data is relatively secondary. You can freely choose if you need to train.
```

</details>

## Ⅱ Pretraining Data

Having learned from MiniMind-V1's low-quality pretraining data that caused models to talk nonsense, after `2025-02-05` we decided no longer to use large-scale unsupervised datasets for pretraining.
Instead, we tried to extract the Chinese portion from the [JiangShu Large Model Dataset](https://www.modelscope.cn/datasets/deepctrl/deepctrl-sft-data),
Clean out about 1.6GB of corpus with character length `<512` and concatenate them directly as pretraining data `pretrain_hq.jsonl`, where hq means high
quality (of course it's not yet high, improving data quality is endless).

The file `pretrain_hq.jsonl` data format is

```json
{"text": "How can I get rid of procrastination? Curing procrastination is not easy, but the following suggestions may help..."}
```

## Ⅲ SFT Data

The [JiangShu Large Model SFT Dataset](https://www.modelscope.cn/datasets/deepctrl/deepctrl-sft-data)
"is a complete, uniformly formatted, and safe large model training and research resource.
It collected and organized a large amount of open-source datasets from public sources on the internet, unified their format, cleaned the data,
containing Chinese datasets with 10M entries and English datasets with 2M entries."
The above is the official introduction. After downloading, the total data volume is about 4B tokens, which is definitely suitable as SFT data for Chinese large language models.
However, the official data format is messy, and using all of it for SFT would be too expensive.
I performed secondary cleaning of the official dataset, removing entries with symbol pollution and noise; additionally, still only kept content with total length `<512`,
hoping to supplement knowledge lacking in the pretraining phase through large amounts of dialogue at this stage.
Export file is `sft_512.jsonl` (~7.5GB).

The [Magpie-SFT Dataset](https://www.modelscope.cn/organization/Magpie-Align)
collected ~1M high-quality conversations from Qwen2/2.5. I further cleaned this data, exporting the portion with total length `<2048` as `sft_2048.jsonl` (~9GB).
The portion with length `<1024` exported as `sft_1024.jsonl` (~5.5GB). Using large model dialogue data directly for sft falls into the "black-box distillation" category.

Further cleaned the SFT data from the previous two steps (keeping only content with high Chinese character ratio), filtered conversations with length `<512`, and obtained `sft_mini_512.jsonl` (~1.2GB).

The data format for all sft files `sft_X.jsonl` is

```text
{
    "conversations": [
        {"role": "user", "content": "Hello"},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello!"},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Goodbye"},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "Goodbye!"}
    ]
}
```

## Ⅳ RLHF Data

From the [Magpie-DPO Dataset](https://www.modelscope.cn/datasets/Magpie-Align/MagpieLM-DPO-Data-v0.1)
approximately 200k preference data entries (all in English) generated from Llama3.1-70B/8B, can be used to train reward models, optimize model reply quality, making it more consistent with human preferences.
Here, we reorganized content with total data length `<3000` into `dpo.jsonl` (~0.9GB), containing two fields `chosen` and `rejected`, where `chosen`
is the preferred reply and `rejected` is the rejected reply.

The file `dpo.jsonl` data format is

```text
{
  "chosen": [
    {"content": "Q", "role": "user"}, 
    {"content": "good answer", "role": "assistant"}
  ], 
  "rejected": [
    {"content": "Q", "role": "user"}, 
    {"content": "bad answer", "role": "assistant"}
  ]
}
```

## Ⅴ Reasoning Dataset:

There's no denying that in February 2025, who can be hotter than DeepSeek...
It also sparked my strong interest in RL-guided reasoning models. I've already reproduced R1-Zero using Qwen2.5.
If I have time + good results (but 99% of base models lack ability), I will later update MiniMind with RL-trained reasoning models rather than distilled models.
With limited time, the fastest low-cost solution is still direct distillation (black-box method).
Unable to resist R1's popularity, in just a few days there are already various R1 distillation datasets like [R1-Llama-70B](https://www.modelscope.cn/datasets/Magpie-Align/Magpie-Reasoning-V2-250K-CoT-Deepseek-R1-Llama-70B), [R1-Distill-SFT](https://www.modelscope.cn/datasets/AI-ModelScope/R1-Distill-SFT),
[Alpaca-Distill-R1](https://huggingface.co/datasets/shareAI/Alpaca-Distill-R1-ZH),
[deepseek_r1_zh](https://huggingface.co/datasets/jinliuxi/deepseek_r1_zh) and so on. Pure Chinese data is relatively scarce.
Finally integrated them, export file as `r1_mix_1024.jsonl`, data format consistent with `sft_X.jsonl`.

Training parameter `max_seq_len` currently refers to the **token length**, not the absolute number of characters.
For this project's tokenizer, typical Chinese text is roughly `1.5~1.7 chars/token`, while pure English text is roughly `4~5 chars/token` (it varies with data distribution).
The “max length” annotated in dataset names is measured in **characters**. For example, a 100-character Chinese string can be roughly converted to `100/1.5≈67` tokens.

For example:

* Chinese: `白日依山尽` (5 chars) may be tokenized into [`白日`, `依`, `山`, `尽`] (4 tokens)
* English: `The sun sets in the west` (24 chars) may be tokenized into [`The `, `sun `, `sets `, `in `, `the`, `west`] (6 tokens)

The “recommended setting” above provides a rough estimate of the max token length for each dataset.
Note that `max_seq_len` can be tuned aggressively / conservatively / in a balanced way: a larger value increases padding waste, while a smaller value increases truncation.

Just find a balance between `compute efficiency` <---> `semantic completeness`.

# 📌 Model

## Structure

MiniMind-Dense (same as [Llama3.1](https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3-1/)) uses the Transformer Decoder-Only structure. The differences from GPT-3 are:

* Adopts GPT-3's pre-normalization method, normalizing at the input of each Transformer sub-layer rather than at the output. Specifically, it uses the RMSNorm normalization function.
* Replaced ReLU with SwiGLU activation function to improve performance.
* Like GPT-Neo, it removed absolute position embeddings and switched to rotary position embeddings (RoPE), which works better when handling inference beyond training length.

---

MiniMind-MoE model structure is based on Llama3 and the MixFFN mixture-of-experts module from [Deepseek-V2/3](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.04434).

* DeepSeek-V2 in feed-forward networks (FFN) uses finer-grained expert splitting and shared expert isolation techniques to improve the effect of Experts.

---

MiniMind's overall structure is consistent, with only small adjustments in RoPE computation, inference functions, and FFN layer code.
The structure is shown in the diagram below (redrawn version):

## Model Configuration

📋 Regarding LLM parameter configuration, there's an interesting paper [MobileLLM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14905) that conducted detailed research and experiments.
Scaling Law has its own unique patterns in small models.
Parameters causing Transformer parameter scaling changes almost entirely depend on `d_model` and `n_layers`.

* `d_model`↑ + `n_layers`↓ -> Wide and short
* `d_model`↓ + `n_layers`↑ -> Narrow and tall

The 2020 Scaling Law paper argued that training data volume, parameter quantity, and training iterations are the key factors determining performance, while model architecture influence is negligible.
However, this law doesn't seem to fully apply to small models.
MobileLLM argues that architecture depth is more important than width, "deep and narrow" "tall and skinny" models can learn more abstract concepts than "wide and shallow" models.
For example, when model parameters are fixed at 125M or 350M, 30-42 layer "narrow" models clearly have superior performance compared to around 12 layer "wide" models,
showing similar trends across 8 benchmark tests including commonsense reasoning, Q&A, and reading comprehension.
This is actually a very interesting discovery, because previously when designing architectures for ~100M scale small models, almost no one tried stacking more than 12 layers.
This is consistent with what MiniMind observed in experiments when adjusting model parameters between `d_model` and `n_layers` during training.
However, "deep and narrow" models also have dimensional limits. When d_model<512, the disadvantage of embedding dimension collapse is very obvious,
and added layers cannot compensate for the disadvantage of insufficient d_head caused by fixed q_head in embeddings.
When d_model>1536, increasing layers seems to have higher priority than d_model, bringing more "cost-effective" parameter -> performance gains.

* Therefore MiniMind sets small model dim=512, n_layers=8 to achieve the balance of "extremely small size <-> better performance."
* Setting dim=768, n_layers=16 to gain larger performance improvements, more consistent with small model Scaling-Law curves.

For reference, GPT3 parameter settings see the table below:

## Ⅱ Main Training (Required)

> All training scripts should be executed in the `cd ./trainer` directory

### **1. Pretraining (Pretrain)**:

What LLMs need to learn first is not to communicate directly with people, but to fill the network parameters with the ink of knowledge. The "ink" should ideally be as saturated as possible, accumulating vast knowledge about the world.
Pretraining is where the model first studies hard to learn a large amount of basic knowledge, such as organizing large-scale high-quality training data from Wikipedia, news, books, etc.
This process is "unsupervised," meaning humans don't need to perform any "supervised" corrections during the process. Instead, the model itself summarizes patterns and learns knowledge from large amounts of text.
The model's goal at this stage is only one: **Learn word prediction**. For example, given the input "Qin Shi Huang," it can continue with "was the first emperor of China."

```bash
torchrun --nproc_per_node 1 train_pretrain.py # 1 means single GPU training, adjust based on your hardware (set >=2 for multiple GPUs)
# or
python train_pretrain.py
```

> After training, the latest model weights are saved as `pretrain_*.pth`; if you want historical versions, use `--save_by` and `--max_ckpts`.

| MiniMind2-Small (512dim) | MiniMind2 (768dim) |
|---|---|
| <img src="./images/pre_512_loss.png"> | <img src="./images/pre_768_loss.png"> |

### **2. Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)**:

After pretraining, the LLM has mastered a lot of knowledge, but at this point it only knows how to do word prediction mindlessly and doesn't know how to chat with people.
The SFT stage requires applying a custom chat template to fine-tune the semi-finished LLM.
For example, after the model encounters such a template [question->answer, question->answer], it no longer does mindless word continuation, but realizes this is the end of a complete conversation.
This process is called instruction fine-tuning, like helping the already knowledgeable "Newton" gentleman adapt to 21st-century smartphone chat habits, learning that the left side of the screen is the other person's message and the right side is the user's message.
During training, MiniMind's instruction and answer lengths are truncated at 512 to save GPU memory. Like learning to write, you start with short articles, and after learning to write 200-character essays, 800-character articles become easy.
When length extension is needed, you only need to prepare a small amount of 2k/4k/8k length dialogue data for further fine-tuning (preferably combined with RoPE-NTK scaling).
> During inference, by adjusting RoPE scaling, it will be convenient to achieve training-free length extrapolation to 2048 and beyond.

```bash
torchrun --nproc_per_node 1 train_full_sft.py
# or
python train_full_sft.py
```

> After training, model weight files are saved by default every `100 steps` as: `full_sft_*.pth` (where *
> is the model's specific dimension, new files overwrite old ones on each save)

| MiniMind2-Small (512dim) | MiniMind2 (768dim) |
|---|---|
| <img src="./images/sft_512_loss.png"> | <img src="./images/sft_768_loss.png"> |

## Ⅲ Other Training Stages (Optional)

> All training scripts should be executed in the `cd ./trainer` directory

### **3. Knowledge Distillation (KD)**

At this point, after all the previous training steps, the model has completely acquired basic capabilities and usually can graduate.
However, knowledge distillation can further optimize model performance and efficiency. Knowledge distillation means the student model learns from the teacher model.
The teacher model is usually a well-trained large model with high accuracy and generalization ability.
The student model is a smaller model whose goal is to learn the teacher model's behavior rather than learn directly from raw data.
In SFT learning, the model's goal is to fit hard labels for token classification (hard labels), i.e., true class labels (such as 0 or 6400).
In knowledge distillation, the teacher model's softmax probability distribution is used as soft labels (soft labels). The small model only learns soft labels and uses KL-Loss to optimize model parameters.
In simple terms, SFT learns the problem-solving answers the teacher gives directly. The KD process is like "opening" the teacher's smart brain and trying to mimic the neural state of the teacher's "brain" thinking about problems.
For example, when the teacher model calculates the problem `1+1=2`, the final layer neurons a state is 0, neuron b state is 100, neuron c state is -99...
The student model learns the operating rules inside the teacher model's brain through large amounts of data. This process is called: knowledge distillation.
Knowledge distillation has only one purpose: make small models smaller in size while having better results.
However, with the birth and development of LLMs, the term model distillation has been widely abused, creating two schools of "white-box/black-box" knowledge distillation.
Closed-source models like GPT-4, since their internal structure cannot be accessed, can only learn from the data they output. This process is called black-box distillation, and is the most common practice in the age of large models.
Black-box distillation is completely identical to the SFT process, except the data is collected from large model outputs. Therefore, you only need to prepare data and further FT.
Note that you need to change the loaded base model to `full_sft_*.pth`, i.e., further distillation learning based on the fine-tuned model.
Both `./dataset/sft_1024.jsonl` and `./dataset/sft_2048.jsonl` are collected from qwen2.5-7/72B-Instruct large models and can be used directly for SFT to acquire some Qwen behavior.

```bash
# Note: need to change the dataset path in train_full_sft.py and max_seq_len
torchrun --nproc_per_node 1 train_full_sft.py
# or
python train_full_sft.py
```

> After training, model weight files are similarly saved by default every `100 steps` as: `full_sft_*.pth` (where * is the model's specific dimension, new files overwrite old ones on each save)

Emphasis should be placed on introducing MiniMind's white-box distillation code `train_distillation.py`. Since there is no powerful teacher model within the same MiniMind series, the white-box distillation code is only for learning reference.

```bash
torchrun --nproc_per_node 1 train_distillation.py
# or
python train_distillation.py
```

### **4. LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**

LoRA is an efficient Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method aimed at fine-tuning pre-trained models through low-rank decomposition.
Compared to full parameter fine-tuning (Full Fine-Tuning), LoRA only needs to update a small number of parameters.
LoRA's core idea is: introduce low-rank decomposition in the model's weight matrices and only update the low-rank parts while keeping the original pre-trained weights unchanged.
Code can be found in `./model/model_lora.py` and `train_lora.py`, completely implementing the LoRA process from scratch without relying on third-party library packaging.

```bash
torchrun --nproc_per_node 1 train_lora.py
# or
python train_lora.py
```

> After training, model weight files are saved by default every `100 steps` as: `lora_xxx_*.pth` (where *
> is the model's specific dimension, new files overwrite old ones on each save)

Many people are confused about how to make models learn knowledge in their private domains, how to prepare datasets, and how to migrate general-purpose models to build domain-specific models.
Here are some examples. For general models lacking medical domain knowledge, you can try adding domain knowledge to the original model to get better performance.
At the same time, you usually don't want to lose other abilities of the original base model while learning domain knowledge. In this case, LoRA can effectively solve this problem.
You only need to prepare dialogue datasets in the following format and place them in `./dataset/lora_xxx.jsonl`, then run `python train_lora.py`
to get the new model weights `./out/lora/lora_xxx.pth`.

**Medical Scenario**

```
 {"conversations": [{"role": "user", "content": "What height should a cervical spondylosis patient's pillow be?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "For cervical spondylosis patients, pillow height selection should be based on..."}]}
 {"conversations": [{"role": "user", "content": "What about xxx"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "xxx..."}]}
```

**Self-awareness Scenario**

```
 {"conversations": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is your name?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "My name is minimind..."}]}
 {"conversations": [{"role": "user", "content": "Who are you"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I am..."}]}
```

At this point, [base model + LoRA model] can acquire medical scenario model-enhanced capabilities, equivalent to adding a LoRA plug-in to the base model, which does not lose the base model's original abilities.
You can test the model through `eval_llm.py` for model evaluation.

```bash
# Note: weight parameter specifies base model type, should match the base model used during train_lora training
python eval_llm.py  --weight dpo --lora_weight lora_medical
```

**Small Test**

```
👶: I've been feeling dizzy recently, what could be the reason?
🤖️: Dizziness could be caused by many reasons, including but not limited to: heart disease, eye damage, allergic reactions, skin problems, allergic reactions, stress, anxiety, fatigue, medication side effects, sexual dysfunction, or others...

---

👶: What is your relationship with openai?
🤖️: I am MiniMind, an artificial intelligence assistant developed by Jingyao Gong. I interact with users through natural language processing and algorithm training.
```

PS: As long as you have the required datasets, you can also do full_sft full parameter fine-tuning (need to mix general knowledge to avoid overfitting domain data making the model worse and losing generality)

### **5. Training Reasoning Models (Reasoning Model)**

DeepSeek-R1 was so popular, almost pointing out a new paradigm for future LLMs.
The paper points out that models `>3B` require multiple iterations of cold starts and RL reward training to achieve visible reasoning ability improvements.
The fastest, most reliable, and most economical approach, as well as recent various so-called reasoning models, are almost all directly distilled from data.
But due to lack of technical sophistication, the distillation school is looked down upon by the RL school (hhhh).
I quickly tried on Qwen 1.5B small model and quickly reproduced math reasoning ability in the Zero process.
However, a regrettable consensus is: models with parameters too small cannot achieve any reasoning effect through cold start SFT+GRPO.
For now, MiniMind firmly chooses to be in the distillation school. If RL on 0.1B models later achieves small progress, this training approach section will be updated.

For distillation, you only need to prepare datasets in the same format as the SFT stage. The dataset source has been introduced above. Data format examples:

```json
{
  "conversations": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Hello, I am Xiaofang, nice to meet you."
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "<think>\nHello! I am a small AI reasoning model R1-Lite-Preview developed by an independent developer in China. I'm happy to serve you!\n</think>\n<answer>\nHello! I am a small AI reasoning model R1-Lite-Preview developed by an independent developer in China. I'm happy to serve you!\n</answer>"
    }
  ]
}
```

The reply template for reasoning model R1 is:

```text
<think>\nThinking process\n</think>\n
<answer>\nFinal answer\n</answer>
```

This is constrained by setting a rule-based reward function in GRPO to make the model comply with thinking tags and reply tags (in the early stages of cold starts, reward values should be increased).

Another issue is that although the distillation process is the same as SFT, experimental results show that models have difficulty consistently complying with template-compliant replies every time, i.e., deviating from thinking and reply tag constraints.
A small trick here is to increase the loss penalty for marker position tokens. See details in `train_reason.py`:

```text
# Add extra penalty to positions corresponding to sp_ids
...
loss_mask[sp_ids] = 10 # penalty coefficient
```

Another tip is that because reasoning data only filtered `<1024` length data, it has fewer multi-turn conversations and English data.
Therefore, `r1_mix_1024.jsonl` mixed approximately 10k multi-turn conversations + English data to prevent serious model forgetting.

The script defaults to reasoning ability distillation fine-tuning based on the rlhf model. You can directly start training:

```bash
torchrun --nproc_per_node 1 train_reason.py
# or
python train_reason.py
```

> After training, model weight files are saved by default every `100 steps` as: `reason_*.pth` (where * is the model's specific dimension, new files overwrite old ones on each save)

Let's test it:

```text
👶: Please introduce yourself.
🤖️: <think>

## IV Reinforcement Learning Training

RL methods in LLMs can be divided into two categories:

1. **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)**

- Train the model by evaluating human **preferences** for model outputs, making it generate content more consistent with human values and preferences.

2. **Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF)**

- Use **AI models** (typically pre-trained language reward models) to provide feedback rather than directly relying on human manual annotation.
- The "AI" here can also be certain rule-based rewards, such as math answer correctness / code executors...

| Type  | Judge | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|-------|-------|-----------|---------------|
| RLHF  | Human | More aligned with real human preferences | High cost, low efficiency |
| RLAIF | Model | Automated, highly scalable | May deviate from real human preferences |

The two are essentially the same, both using **reinforcement learning** to utilize certain forms of "**feedback**" to optimize model behavior.

Except for the different **feedback** sources, there are no other differences.

### 👀 Unified Perspective on PO Algorithms

Before introducing specific algorithm implementations, I'll present my personal understanding of the unified commonality of all Policy Optimization (PO) algorithms in a minimalist perspective.

The essence of all RL algorithms is only optimizing one expectation:

$$\mathcal{J}_{PO} = \mathbb{E}_{q \sim P(Q), o \sim \pi(O|q)} \left[ \underbrace{f(r_t)}_{\text{policy term}} \cdot \underbrace{g(A_t)}_{\text{advantage term}} - \underbrace{h(\text{KL}_t)}_{\text{regularization term}} \right]$$

During training, only **minimize the negative objective function**, i.e.: $\mathcal{L_{PO}}=-\mathcal{J_{PO}}$

This framework contains only three core components:
* **Policy term** $f(r_t)$: How to use probability ratio $r_t$? Tell the model how large the deviation between new and old policies is, whether better tokens are explored
* **Advantage term** $g(A_t)$: How to calculate advantage $A_t$, this is important! Large models solving definite integrals is unremarkable, small models answering addition/subtraction correctly usually have positive advantages
* **Regularization term** $h(\text{KL}_t)$: How to constrain the change magnitude $\text{KL}_t$, both preventing drift and not being too rigid

<details>
<summary>(Expand) Symbol Explanation</summary>

| Symbol | Meaning | Explanation | Range |
|--------|---------|------------|-------|
| $q$ | Question/prompt | Sampled from dataset $P(Q)$ | - |
| $o$ | Model output sequence | Generated by policy $\pi$ | - |
| $r_t$ | Probability ratio | $r_t = \frac{\pi_\theta(o_t\|q, o_{<t})}{\pi_{ref}(o_t\|q, o_{<t})}$ | $(0, +\infty)$ |
| $A_t$ | Advantage function | Measures how good an action is compared to baseline | $(-\infty, +\infty)$ |
| $\text{KL}_t$ | KL divergence | Prevent policy from deviating too far from reference model | $[0, +\infty)$ |

</details>

Different **xxPO algorithms** are essentially just different design instantiations of these three components!

---

### **6. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)**

In the previous training steps, the model has acquired basic conversation abilities, but these are completely based on word prediction, lacking the motivation of positive and negative examples.
The model doesn't yet know what answers are good and what are bad. We hope it can be more aligned with human preferences, reducing the probability of unsatisfactory answers.
This process is like having the model undergo new training, learning from excellent employees as examples and passive employees as counter-examples, to learn how to respond better.

#### 6.1 Direct Preference Optimization

Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) algorithm loss:

$$\mathcal{L}_{DPO} = -\mathbb{E}\left[\log \sigma\left(\beta \left[\log \frac{\pi_\theta(y_w|x)}{\pi_{ref}(y_w|x)} - \log \frac{\pi_\theta(y_l|x)}{\pi_{ref}(y_l|x)}\right]\right)\right]$$

Where:
- **Policy term**: $f(r_t) = \log r_w - \log r_l$ (contrast probability ratios of chosen vs rejected)
- **Advantage term**: $g(A_t)$ = / (through preference contrast, no need to explicitly calculate advantage)
- **Regularization term**: $h(\text{KL}_t)$ = implicit in $\beta$ (control deviation from reference model)

Specifically:
- DPO derives an analytical training objective for preference pairs from PPO with KL constraints, directly maximizing the log-odds that "chosen outperforms rejected"; no need to simultaneously train Reward/Value models. DPO only needs to run two models `actor` and `ref`, with low GPU memory usage, stable convergence, and simple implementation.
- Training paradigm: off-policy, using static preference datasets, can repeat multiple epochs; Ref model is fixed (outputs pre-cached).
- DPO's limitation is no online exploration, more used for "preference/safety" human value alignment; limited improvement in "intellectual ability" to solve problems correctly (of course this depends on the dataset, collecting large-scale positive and negative samples with human evaluation is difficult).

```bash
torchrun --nproc_per_node 1 train_dpo.py
# or
python train_dpo.py
```

> After training, model weight files are saved by default every `100 steps` as: `dpo_*.pth` (where * is the model's specific dimension, new files overwrite old ones on each save)

### **7. Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF)**

Compared to RLHF which relies on human-annotated chosen/rejected preference pairs, RLAIF has AI completely act as the "judge."
The so-called AI "judge" can be a model-based reward large model (Reward Model), can be like R1 setting rule-based functions for validation, or can be environmental feedback like tool calling.
For example: whether math problem answers are correct, whether code execution passes test cases, whether reasoning processes meet format requirements...can all be automatically judged.
RLAIF's greatest advantage is its **scalability** and **On-Policy** characteristics——no need for expensive human annotation, can generate massive training samples, letting models quickly evolve through large-scale online trial and error.

MiniMind implements **2+N** basic + cutting-edge RLAIF methods:
* **PPO**, **GRPO** are classic RL algorithms widely validated at scale;
* N cutting-edge RL algorithms (updated irregularly with experimental nature).

#### 1️⃣ Dataset Preparation (Required)

To quickly verify RLAIF effectiveness, 10,000 high-quality conversations were randomly sampled from the SFT dataset, building about 1MB size `rlaif-mini.jsonl` ([Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/datasets/jingyaogong/minimind_dataset/blob/main/rlaif-mini.jsonl))

Data format is consistent with SFT, but assistant content is not needed, because during training it's completely real-time sampled and generated by the $\Pi$ policy model. Thus:

```json
{
    "conversations": [
        {"role": "user", "content": "Explain what photosynthesis is?"},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "None"}
    ]
}
```

During RLAIF training, the model generates 1 or more candidate answers based on user questions, then a reward function/model scores the answers.
High-scoring answers are encouraged (increase $\Pi$ policy probability), low-scoring answers are suppressed (decrease $\Pi$ policy probability). This "score->adjust" loop is the core of reinforcement learning.

#### 2️⃣ Reward Model Preparation (Required)

It's known that RLAIF training requires a "reward model (Reward Model)" to score generated answers.

We select the small and high-quality InternLM2-1.8B-Reward
([ModelScope](https://modelscope.cn/models/Shanghai_AI_Laboratory/internlm2-1_8b-reward) | [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/internlm/internlm2-1_8b-reward))
as the base reward model.

After downloading the reward model, it needs to be placed in the **same level directory** as the minimind project. The recommended structure is:

```
project/
├── minimind/                    # MiniMind project
│   ├── model/
│   └── ...
└── internlm2-1_8b-reward/       # Reward model (same level as minimind)
    ├── config.json
    ├── model.safetensors
    └── ...
```

<details>
<summary><b>Reward Mechanism Choice and MiniMind Limitations (Click to expand)</b></summary>

**1. Diversity of Reward Mechanisms**

The "reward signal" source in RLAIF can be very flexible:

- **Model-based rewards**: Can use dedicated Reward Models (like InternLM2-Reward), or use general LLMs + prompts for scoring (like Qwen3-as-a-Judge). Reward model scale and architecture are freely selectable.

- **Rule-based rewards**: Can construct reward signals based on rule functions, for example:
  - Math problem answer correctness verification (Ground Truth comparison)
  - SQL execution success rate and result accuracy
  - Code interpreter run results (pass@k)
  - Tool call return status (API success/failure)
  - Format compliance checks (JSON/XML parsing)
  - Reasoning chain completeness evaluation (CoT step count)

- **Environment-based rewards**: In Agent scenarios, environmental feedback itself is natural reward (like game scores, Research completeness, task completion).

Any mechanism that can quantify "answer quality" can serve as an RL reward source. DeepSeek R1 is a typical case: using rule-based functions to verify math answer correctness as reward, no need for additional Reward Models.

**2. MiniMind Limitation: Reward Sparsity Problem**

RLAIF training can be applied to both reasoning and non-reasoning models, the difference is only in format.

However, for MiniMind with such tiny 0.1B parameters and weak abilities, on general tasks (like R1-style math datasets) it encounters serious reward sparsity (Reward Sparsity) problems:

- **Phenomenon**: Model-generated candidate answers are almost all wrong, causing all reward scores $r(x,y) \approx 0$
- **Consequence**: Advantage function $A(x,y) = r(x,y) - b(x) \approx 0$, policy gradient signal disappears, cannot effectively update parameters $\theta$

Like having elementary school students do high school math exams, no matter how many attempts they get zero, cannot learn to improve strategies through score differences. This is a fundamental principle limitation of RL algorithms.

To mitigate this problem, MiniMind's implementation chose **model-based continuous reward signals**:

- Reward Model outputs continuous scores (like -2.5 to +3.0), not binary 0/1
- Even if answer quality is all poor, can still distinguish subtle differences between "much worse" (-3.0) and "worse" (-2.8). So this **dense and continuous** reward signal can provide non-zero gradients to the advantage function $A(x,y)$, enabling gradual policy network optimization
- Can also mix multiple reward sources: $r_{\text{total}} = \alpha \cdot r_{\text{model}} + \beta \cdot r_{\text{rule}}$ (for example, can detect think tag format rewards while also synthesizing answer quality reward scores)
- In minimind practice, avoid directly using rule-based binary rewards + out-of-scope difficulty data (like MATH500), which easily leads to all-zero rewards;
- Monitor reward score variance $\text{Var}(r)$ during training, if it consistently approaches 0 need to adjust data or reward mechanism

**For Production-Scale Large Models in Agentic RL Scenarios**:

In real Agent systems (code generation, tool calling, retrieval-planning-execution multi-turn pipelines), rewards are different paradigms of "delayed round settlement":

- LLM needs to generate tool call instructions token-by-token (tool_call), go through parsing (tool_parse), tool execution (tool_exec), then splice results back to context for next step; repeat until completion.
- One complete task pipeline includes multiple calls+thinking, calculate total reward once until termination condition is met (like whether task is complete, whether tests pass, whether targets are hit).

Therefore, Agentic RL is closer to sparse/delayed reward settings: gradient backprop happens "after the round ends," very different from non-Agentic RL tasks with "instant scoring and instant updates" on single conversation rounds.
This also explains why Agent tasks favor environment feedback (environment-based reward) rather than static reward model scoring.

- **Environmental interaction feedback**: Final results matter (code runs, API returns success, sub-goals complete);
- **Model-based reward limitations**: Limited capture of long pipelines and executable semantics, likely inconsistent with real environmental feedback (reward hacking).

#### 7.1 [Proximal Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06347)

PPO is a very classic reinforcement learning algorithm proposed by OpenAI in 2017, and is the universal baseline method for LLM RL.

**PPO Loss**:
$$\mathcal{L}_{PPO} = -\mathbb{E}\left[\min(r_t \cdot A_t, \text{clip}(r_t, 1-\varepsilon, 1+\varepsilon) \cdot A_t)\right] + \beta \cdot \mathbb{E}[\text{KL}]$$

Where:
- **Policy term**: $f(r_t) = \min(r_t, \text{clip}(r_t, 1-\varepsilon, 1+\varepsilon))$ (clip probability ratio to prevent aggressive updates)
- **Advantage term**: $g(A_t) = R - V(s)$ (estimate value function through Critic network)
- **Regularization term**: $h(\text{KL}_t) = \beta \cdot \mathbb{E}[\text{KL}]$ (global KL divergence constraint)

Comparing to DPO:
- DPO (Off-Policy): Training data is a static preference dataset (chosen vs rejected), can repeatedly use the same batch of data to train multiple epochs, just like traditional supervised learning. High data efficiency, low training cost. Directly optimizes log-likelihood of preference pairs, no Reward Model needed.
- PPO (On-Policy): Must use current policy to real-time sample new data, old policy-collected data cannot be used (distribution shift problem). Although importance sampling and clip mechanisms allow slight distribution shifts, essentially requires data from relatively fresh policies. Low data efficiency, but suited for explorative learning.

In simple terms:

- The former teaches models to learn by offline preset "good/bad standards," even if not outputtable by current models (like practicing ball hitting by watching world champion/runner-up videos);
- The latter teaches models real-time to do things right, online sampling from newest model policy (coach hand-teaching, real-time scoring each action).

MiniMind's PPO implementation includes Actor model (generate answers) and Critic model (evaluate answer value), and complete GAE (Generalized Advantage Estimation) advantage function calculation.

**Training**:

```bash
torchrun --nproc_per_node N train_ppo.py
# or
python train_ppo.py
```

> After training, model weight files are saved by default every `100 steps` as: `ppo_actor_*.pth` (where * is the model's specific dimension)

| MiniMind2-Small (512dim) | MiniMind2 (768dim) |
|---|---|
| <img src="./images/train_ppo_512.png"> | <img src="./images/train_ppo_768.png"> |

From the training curves, you can see PPO has the problem of **slow reward improvement**. I believe this mainly stems from **PPO's dual-network joint optimization** method: Critic needs to gradually converge to accurately estimate value functions, and Actor's policy updates depend on Critic-provided advantage estimates, the two interdependent forming complex optimization. Early training period Critic estimates inaccurately affects Actor gradient direction, leading to slow overall convergence. Furthermore, PPO needs to maintain two networks simultaneously, GPU memory usage about 1.5-2x single-network methods.

#### 7.2 [Group Relative Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03300)

In early 2025, DeepSeek-R1 became extremely popular, and equally popular was the GRPO algorithm from the DeepSeekMath paper, also becoming one of the most advanced RL algorithms. However, AI six months equals humanity six months, and by now GRPO has evolved into the baseline algorithm of the great XXPO wars (later evolved DAPO, GSPO, CISPO, etc.). In short, the core innovation is "group relative value estimation."

**GRPO Loss**:

$$\mathcal{L}_{GRPO} = -\mathbb{E}\left[r_t \cdot A_t - \beta \cdot \text{KL}_t\right]$$

Where:
- **Policy term**: $f(r_t) = \min(r_t, \text{clip}(r_t))$ (use probability ratio with clip clipping)
- **Advantage term**: $g(A_t) = \frac{R - \mu_{group}}{\sigma_{group}}$ (within-group normalization, eliminate Critic network)
- **Regularization term**: $h(\text{KL}_t) = \beta \cdot \text{KL}_t$ (token-level KL divergence constraint)

For the same question, the model generates N different answers (for example N=4), then calculates reward scores for these N answers.
Next, use the average reward of these N answers as baseline. Answers above baseline are encouraged, answers below baseline are suppressed.
This cleverly avoids training an additional critic network.

Just as all RL faces the principle limitation of positive and negative samples, GRPO is no exception. Its more significant problem is: degenerate groups (Degenerate Groups).
Suppose a question is slightly difficult, causing N answer reward scores to be nearly identical (usually equally bad rather than equally good), then this group's learning signal approaches zero.
On MiniMind such ultra-small models, this problem is especially obvious. When solving math problems 99.99% of the time the entire group answer quality is poor, then cannot learn.
Therefore, must specify reasonable domain for the model, i.e., must limit within capability boundaries.

**Training**:

```bash
torchrun --nproc_per_node N train_grpo.py
# or
python train_grpo.py
```

> After training, model weight files are saved by default every `100 steps` as: `grpo_*.pth`

| MiniMind2-Small (512dim) | MiniMind2 (768dim) |
|---|---|
| <img src="./images/train_grpo_512.png"> | <img src="./images/train_grpo_768.png"> |

From the training curves, you can see GRPO's **reward shows more stable upward trend**, reaching around 4, indicating GRPO itself better utilizes RLAIF signals. Policy Loss generally decreases smoothly. Compared to PPO's dual-network optimization, GRPO's single-network architecture trains more stably with higher convergence ceiling.

#### 7.3 ⏳⌛️🔥 More RL Extensions (Exp)

##### 7.3.1 [Single-stream Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13232)

SPO is an RL algorithm Tencent proposed in September 2025, improving on GRPO's degenerate group problem.
The paper argues that GRPO and similar algorithms' requirement that "one sample depends on a group of samples" seems awkward and inelegant: too-easy or too-hard questions result in the entire group learning nearly nothing, learning efficiency is inherently limited.
SPO's motivation is to return to RL's essence——**1 input, 1 output, is 1 training sample**, returning to basic policy gradient formulas: can get stable baseline without group mean, i.e., spread value estimate V across time dimension, do rough value pre-estimation before training, update V estimate during training while sampling, thus providing each sample with a persistent, adaptive baseline across batches. This "single-stream" design no longer depends on same-group samples, naturally avoiding degenerate groups.

**SPO Loss**:

$$\mathcal{L}_{SPO} = -\mathbb{E}\left[\log \pi_\theta(a_t|s) \cdot A_t - \beta \cdot \text{KL}_t\right]$$

Where:
- **Policy term**: $f(r_t) = \log \pi_\theta(a_t|s)$ (directly use log probability, don't calculate ratio)
- **Advantage term**: $g(A_t) = R - B_t^{adaptive}$ (adaptive baseline, Beta distribution dynamic tracking)
- **Regularization term**: $h(\text{KL}_t) = \beta \cdot \text{KL}_t$ (token-level KL + dynamic $\rho$ adjustment)

At implementation level: SPO uses non-grouped design, uses persistent KL-adaptive value tracker to replace within-group baseline, advantage functions globally normalized across entire batch. This way each sample processed independently, no need to wait for other same-group samples, yet provides stable learning signals for each sample.
On Qwen3-8B's 5 difficult math datasets, SPO averages 3.4 percentage points higher than GRPO, with BRUMO 25 dataset +7.3pp, AIME 25 dataset +4.4pp.

> Note: SPO is an experimental cutting-edge algorithm, MiniMind's implementation is for exploratory learning. Due to extremely small model parameters, cannot fully reproduce paper's 8B model results.

**Training**:

```bash
torchrun --nproc_per_node N train_spo.py
# or
python train_spo.py
```

> After training, model weight files are saved by default every `100 steps` as: `spo_*.pth`

<div align="center">
<img src="./images/train_spo_768.png">
<p><i>MiniMind2 (768dim) Training Curve</i></p>
</div>

Looking at the training curves, SPO's reward fluctuation is similar to PPO, weaker than GRPO. Actual inference testing found model output quality is not high, with logic confusion and format error issues.

**Experimental Note**: Current SPO hand-implemented version may have problems in value_tracker configuration, reward normalization strategy. Still needs to check algorithm's adaptability on small models/or implementation differences.

### RL Algorithm Summary

We return to the "**unified framework**", reorganizing the table showing all different PO algorithms are just different instantiations of three core components:

| Algorithm | Policy Term $f(r_t)$ | Advantage Term $g(A_t)$ | Regularization Term $h(\text{KL}_t)$ | Optimized Models |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|----------------------|----------|
| **DPO** | $\log r_w - \log r_l$ | Implicit (preference contrast) | Implicit in $\beta$ | 2 |
| **PPO** | $\min(r, \text{clip}(r))$ | $R - V(s)$ | $\beta \cdot \mathbb{E}[\text{KL}]$ | 4 |
| **GRPO** | $\min(r, \text{clip}(r))$ | $\frac{R - \mu}{\sigma}$ | $\beta \cdot \text{KL}_t$ | 2 |
| **SPO** | $\log \pi_\theta$ | $R - B_t^{adaptive}$ | $\beta \cdot \text{KL}_t$ | 2 |

**RL is Elegant and Self-Consistent**

👉 **Results Summary**

Full_sft models perform better in simplicity and information accuracy; rlhf models tend to provide more background information in answers, but information accuracy needs improvement.
Overall, RLHF-trained models tend to learn: speaking more polite but useless nonsense to please "conversation" itself, while having slight loss in information accuracy.
There's no free lunch. Still need to improve RLHF dataset quality and accept unavoidable model capability losses.
The difference between DPO and online PPO is that reject and chosen are both prepared offline, and necessarily have large distribution differences from minimind model outputs.
Simply put, DPO algorithm makes models watch "video" of table tennis world champion's techniques for RL, rather than like PPO asking reward models to act as "coaches" to correct their techniques for RL.

[Q]: 谁提出了万有引力定律？
[A]: 万有引力定律是由牛顿在17世纪提出的，是牛顿三大定律之一。牛顿在17世纪提出的万有引力定律揭示了万有引力定律的本质，并解释了行星、卫星、彗星和其他天体之间的引力相互作用。这一理论是由牛顿在1687年提出的。通过分析和实验，他成功地解释了天体之间的引力相互作用，从而解释了地球绕太阳公转的现象。
[B]: 万有引力（人类政策）是牛顿三大力学定律之一，用于描述两个物体之间的相互作用。它包括万有引力定律和牛顿第一定律（惯性定律）。万有引力定律来源于两个物体之间的相互作用，其质量、距离和速度决定了它们之间的相互作用。这种相互作用是：质量的乘积：质量的乘积是万有引力定律和牛顿第二定律的乘积。质量的乘积：质量的乘积是两个物体之间的物理过程，两个物体之间的相互作用。对于其他物体，它们的质量可以表示为两个物体之间的质量之和，即引力加速度a。
[C]: 万有引力是牛顿在1687年提出的物理概念，描述了物体之间的引力相互作用。
[D]: 万有引力是由英国物理学家牛顿提出的。他相信所有物体都会产生引力，这种引力是由物体的质量和距离决定的。这一理论揭示了质量和距离之间的关系，并证明了万有引力定律的本质。
[E]: 万有引力是由牛顿在1687年提出的，它是宇宙中的一个基本物理现象，描述了物体之间的相互作用。这种力被称为万有引力，存在于所有物体之间，这种力与物体的质量和距离有关。万有引力是自然界中最基本的力之一，不仅影响物体的运动和变化，而且对宇宙的结构和演化也有重要影响。
[F]: 万有引力是由英国物理学家牛顿在17世纪提出的。
[G]: 引力是宇宙中由质量和能量组成的力。根据牛顿的万有引力定律，一个物体的引力与它的质量和距离成正比。因此，牛顿的万有引力定律表明，一个物体的引力与它的质量和距离成正比。这一定律在物理学、天文学和物理学中都有广泛的应用。
[H]: 万有引力是由英国物理学家牛顿在1687年提出的。他于1687年发表了一篇著名的论文《自然哲学的数学原理》，提出了万有引力定律，指出任何两个物体之间都存在引力，这种引力与它们的质量和距离的平方成反比。这一定律被称为万有引力定律，描述了质量和距离之间的关系。它指出两个物体之间的引力与它们的质量和距离的平方成反比。这一定律对于解释许多现象和宇宙中的相互作用非常重要，例如行星绕太阳公转、恒星之间的引力透镜效应等。它也在天文学、物理学和工程学领域得到了广泛应用，为我们理解自然和宇宙的本质和演化提供了重要的理论基础。

[Q]: 你知道大熊猫的主要食物是什么吗？
[A]: 大熊猫主要以竹子为食，但也吃其他植物、昆虫、小型哺乳动物和鱼。它们的消化系统与熊相似，能够消化竹子。大熊猫有锋利的牙齿，适合咀嚼竹子，所以它们通常被称为"竹子动物"。
[B]: 大熊猫是草食哺乳动物，以竹子为食，也是肉食动物。它们的主要是竹子，尤其是富含纤维素和矿物质的竹子，这些竹子不会直接进入消化系统。大熊猫的肠道主要由竹子组成，需要消化纤维素和其他纤维在竹子中以支持正常喂养。
[C]: 大熊猫主要以竹子为食，但也吃其他植物，包括叶子、嫩芽、昆虫、水果、蔬菜和小型哺乳动物。大熊猫是中国特有的，属于熊科，主要分布在四川、陕西和甘肃地区。
[D]: 大熊猫的主要食物是竹子。它们通常吃竹子，每天需要吃大约30公斤的竹子。
[E]: 是的，大熊猫主要以竹子为食。它们需要每天吃大量的竹子来维持生命，每天需要吃40到80公斤的竹子。此外，它们还吃一些其他植物，如草、水果、坚果和小型哺乳动物。
[F]: 大熊猫主要以竹子为食，但偶尔也会吃其他植物和动物。此外，大熊猫还吃一些野生水果、小型动物和植物，但这些并不是它们的主要食物来源。
[G]: 大熊猫的主要食物是竹子。
[H]: 大熊猫是植物性动物，主要食物是竹子。它们的肠道结构适合消化富含纤维素的竹子，但它们也吃一些其他植物，如草本植物和小型哺乳动物。大熊猫的肠道结构也适应了高纤维竹子，使它们能够消化大量的纤维素，帮助它们在野外生存。大熊猫的肠道中也含有一种叫做"纤维素酶"的酶，可以帮助大熊猫分解纤维素，帮助它们消化大量的水和营养物质。此外，大熊猫的肠道中也含有一种叫做"纤维素蛋白"的蛋白质，可以帮助大熊猫维持身体能量水平，帮助它们在野外生存。总之，大熊猫的主要食物是竹子，但它们也吃一些其他植物，如草本植物和小型哺乳动物。

[Q]: 为什么海水是咸的？
[A]: 海水是咸的主要是因为它的化学成分。海水含有大量的矿物质和盐分，主要成分是硫酸盐、碳酸盐、镁离子和钾离子。这些物质在高浓度下会在海水中沉淀，形成海水。具体来说，海水中矿物质和盐分主要来自岩石、土壤、生物和人类排泄物。岩石是海水的组成部分，主要由石英、长石、云母等矿物质组成。土壤中含有大量的化学物质，如氮、磷、钾等，这些化学物质会渗入土壤，形成土壤。生物排泄物中的盐分主要来自植物叶绿素和其他色素，这些色素吸收阳光并将其转化为能量，供生物使用。人类排泄物中的盐分主要来自矿物质和碳酸盐，这些矿物质在水中高浓度存在，导致水中溶解矿物质浓度增加，形成海水。因此，海水是咸的主要是因为它的化学成分和结构特征。矿物质和盐分在海水中主要来自岩石、土壤、生物和人类排泄物，这些物质在海水中积累和排泄，导致海水变咸。
[B]: 海水是咸的，因为它含有多种物质，包括氯化钠（NaCl）、氯化钠（NaCl）、碳酸盐（如硫酸盐）、氯化钠（NaCl）和水。咸物质的来源：盐是一种常见的咸味来源，含有钾、钙、镁、钾和其他矿物质。这些矿物质通常来自地下水、地下水或土壤，浓度远低于纯水。咸味的原因：咸味主要来自水中的小颗粒盐。这些小颗粒主要通过植物根部和动物体内的微生物传播，如昆虫、小型哺乳动物、鸟类和某些昆虫。总之，海水是咸的，因为它含有大量的盐分，包括矿物质、岩石、盐、矿物质等，这些物质在海水中高浓度存在，对咸味产生重要影响。
[C]: 海水是咸的主要是因为它含有各种盐分，海水是其中主要成分之一。当海水含有大量盐分时，这些盐分溶解在海水中形成咸味。海水中盐分主要来自溶解盐分、蒸发沉淀和冰冻海水形成的盐分。
[D]: 海水中含有许多盐分，这些盐分可以增加海水的咸度。海水中盐分主要来自海水中溶解的盐分，这些盐分可以从海水中获得。氧化物和海水中盐分可以与海水中盐分形成氢键，从而增加海水的咸度。
[E]: 海水是咸的，因为它含有大量的盐分，包括氯离子和氯离子。这些离子在海洋中形成大量盐分，称为盐。海水中含有许多溶解的盐分，这些盐分随着海水的上升而蒸发，最终导致海水中盐分蒸发。这些盐分完全被海水消耗，然后从海水中排除。此外，海水中还含有许多其他盐分，但这些盐分不同，因为它们的浮动和下沉过程不同。海水中提取的盐分来自海底的岩石，这些盐分在海水中可利用。总之，海水是咸的，因为海水中含有许多盐分和盐分。
[F]: 海水中含有许多溶解的盐分，其中最主要的是氯化钠。当盐加入水中时，盐分子与水分子反应形成氢氧化钠，这是一种盐。
[G]: 因为许多生物需要水才能生存，它可以通过吸收和释放二氧化碳、释放氧气、保持大气中的水蒸气、保持水循环来实现。水中的盐分和化学物质释放氧气，使地球上的生物能够呼吸。此外，水还有许多其他功能，如保持水循环、调节气候和环境等。水对许多生物的生存至关重要，也是许多自然现象的重要基础。
[H]: 海水是咸的主要是因为它含有大量的溶解盐分，其中最主要的是氯化钠（NaCl）。氯化钠是一种非常常见的盐，存在于地球上的海洋、湖泊、河流和地下水中。当海水从海洋蒸发时，它会带走一些盐，使海水变咸。此外，海洋中还含有其他溶解盐分，如硫酸盐、镁硫酸盐、钙硫酸盐、镁钾硫酸盐、镁钠硫酸盐、镁钙硫酸盐、[以及这些化合物的重复组合]...

[Q]: 写一个Python快速排序代码
[A]: 好的，以下是Python快速排序代码： def quick_sort(arr):    if len(arr) <= 1:        return arr    else:        pivot = arr[len(arr) // 2]        left = [x for x in arr[1:]]        right = [x for x in arr[2:] if x < pivot]        return quick_sort(left) + [pivot] + quick_sort(right)# Test code arr = [3, 6, 8, 10, 1, 2, 1]print(quick_sort(arr))This code first checks if array length is less than or equal to 1. If so, it arranges from smallest to largest. Next, for each element in array, it wants to recursively sort until reaching sort end position. If array length is odd, it arranges from largest to smallest. Finally, average time complexity is O(n log n), where n is array length.
[B]: 以下是使用Python实现的快速排序算法： def sort_array(arr):    # Generate random arrangement    sorted_array = sorted(arr)    # Return sorted list    return sorted(arr)# Example arr = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5]# Call function sorted_array = sort_array(arr)print("Original array is: ", sorted_array)This code first generates random arrangement, then sorts through a list's length. Finally returns sorted list. Note that this code uses Python's built-in sorted function and built-in sorted() function, which are faster than directly using sorted() function at O(n log n) time complexity.
[C]: 以下是适用于小数组的简单排序算法： def quick_sort(arr):    if len(arr) <= 1:        return arr    else    for _ in range(2, 51):        if arr[len(arr) - 1:] is not None:            arr[len(arr) - 1] = arr[len(arr) - 1]                arr[len(arr)] = arr[len(arr)]    return quick_sort(arr)# Example arr = [3, 5, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1]sorted_arr = quick_sort(arr)print("Sorted array is:", sorted_arr)### Code Explanation: 1. **Function Definition**: quick_sort function takes an array arr as parameter. 2. **Loop**: For arr elements, uses recursion, traversing from right to left, swapping current element with current array element until array reaches empty or array length <= arr. 3. **Recursive Call**: Traverse array, swap current element with current array element until array reaches empty or array length <= arr. 4. **Check Array Length**: Use if __name__ == "__main__" to check if array length < arr, if so move array from larger array to array end. 5. **Output Sorted Results**
[D]: 作为AI语言模型，我无法编写Python程序。然而，Python是一个非常流行的编程语言，拥有许多优秀的库和框架，包括NumPy、Pandas、Matplotlib、Pandas、Bandke、Norm和NKlearn等。Python有许多优秀的自然语言处理库和框架，用于处理和分析各种类型的数据，如文本、图像、音频、视频等。Python还可以创建各种应用程序，如网络搜索、游戏开发、科学计算等。Python非常灵活，也支持多种编程风格，因此可以轻松找到合适的解决方案。
[E]: 作为AI语言模型，我可以回答你的问题。然而，我无法执行编程操作，因为我无法确定你询问的是哪种编程语言。请提供更具体的问题，以便我更好地回答你的问题。
[F]: 快速排序（快速排序）是一种简单的排序算法，它将数据分成小部分，通过规则对每个部分进行排序，最终得到一个有序数组。
[G]: 好的，以下是快速排序的Python代码 ```python sorted_print(sorted(sorted(sorted(sorted_print))```Output is: ```[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]```
[H]: 快速排序是一种基于分治法的排序算法，时间复杂度为O(n log n)。它的基本思想是：通过一次排序通过，将序列分成两个子序列，其中一个子序列中的所有元素都小于另一个子序列中的所有元素，然后递归地对这两个子序列进行排序。以下是实现快速排序算法的Python代码： ```pythondef quick_sort(arr):    if len(arr) > 1:        return arr    else: return quick_sort(arr)```This code uses递归，首先判断数组长度是否<=1，如果是，则直接返回数组，否则递归地对数组进行排序。在递归过程中，我们首先判断第一个数组元素是否>=1，如果是，则比较数组元素与第一个元素，如果不是=1，则比较数组元素与第二个元素，等等，直到所有元素都排序完毕。这种代码的时间复杂度为O(n log n)，是一种非常实用的排序算法。

### 👉 Subjective Results Summary

Personal subjective evaluation basically aligns with DeepSeek-R1, where:

* MiniMind series ranking very intuitive, larger parameters + sufficient training data score higher. Hallucinations and errors obviously better than small models.

* Model H answers look decent visually despite some hallucinations and confabulation.

* Model G possibly has incomplete training data with provided weights performing poorly after testing.

* Revisiting the timeless Scaling Law: larger parameters, more training data → stronger model performance.

---

## Ⅳ RoPE Long-text Extrapolation

MiniMind supports RoPE position encoding length extrapolation through YaRN algorithm, enabling models to handle text sequences exceeding training length.

For native torch models, when using `eval_llm.py` for inference, just add `--inference_rope_scaling` parameter to enable RoPE extrapolation:

```bash
python eval_llm.py --weight full_sft --inference_rope_scaling
```

For Transformers format models, add the following configuration to config.json to enable length extrapolation:

```json
"rope_scaling": {
    "type": "yarn",
    "factor": 16.0,
    "original_max_position_embeddings": 2048,
    "beta_fast": 32.0,
    "beta_slow": 1.0,
    "attention_factor": 1.0
}
```

Testing on MiniMind-Small model with different lengths of "Journey to the West" vernacular fiction text to evaluate perplexity (PPL) comparison before and after RoPE scaling.
You can see that after enabling YaRN extrapolation, the model's PPL performance on long texts significantly decreases:

<div align="center">
<img src="./images/rope_ppl.png">
</div>

## Ⅴ Objective Benchmarks

Performance comparisons with other small models on Chinese language leaderboards including C-Eval, CMMLU, A-CLUE, TMMLU+...

Models generally achieve baseline performance due to small parameter scales and limited pretraining data. MiniMind without targeted leaderboard optimization provides fair reference results.
